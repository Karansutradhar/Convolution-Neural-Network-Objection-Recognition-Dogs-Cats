Image Classification Convolution Neural Network

Microsoft's Famous Dogs Vs Cats

Instructions:

The dataset "dogs-vs-cats" must be placed in the same directory as "Convolution_Neural_Network.py"
and unzipped before the program is executed.
Additionally, the "test1" and "train" folders must be unzipped.
All of these zip files should simply be unzipped in their respective directories.

After unzipping these files, the program may simply be run with the following:

python3 -u Convolution_Neural_Network.py

 * numpy
 * cv2
 * os
 * random
 * tqdm
 * matplotlib
 * glob
